B compiler
==========

The compiler generates the original threaded code as described
[here](git@github.com:aap/b.git) potentially for different platforms
PDP-11 and amd64 seem to be working.
I started PDP-8 at some point but I never bothered to implement the runtime.
amd64 output should be working, runtime is not done yet.
pdp-8 output should be mostly working, runtime not started yet.

The state of this thing is rather chaotic right now. sorry.

TODO
====

- Get rid of chaos
- Write a compiler in B itself
